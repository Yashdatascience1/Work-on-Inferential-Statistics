# Inferential-Statistics-Automated
An automated version of Inferential statistics. Click [here](https://yashdatascience1-work-on-inferential-statistics-code1-6y9rgx.streamlit.app/) 
to access the app.

## **Description of the application**.
This application is designed for doing Inferential Statistics. One can use this to estimate the confidence interval as well as to do hypothesis testing. This application uses some of the parametric tests to perform hypothesis testing. Assumptions made for those tests are also mentioned. The input data can be in the form of one number or an array.

### **This app has two parts**:
1. Confidence Interval Estimation
2. Hypothesis testing

## **Confidence interval estimation**
This part deals with answering the question: **With what confidence can you say that your parameter of interest lies in a certain interval?**

With the app you will be able to:

1. Estimate the confidence interval for population mean(μ) when population standard deviation(σ) is known
2. Estimate the confidence interval for population mean(μ) when population standard deviation(σ) is unknown
3. Estimate the confidence interval for difference between two means
4. Estimate the confidence interval for population proportion(π) basis the sample proportion(p̂)

## **Hypothesis Testing**

This part deal with answering question: **If this claim is true for my sample, does it mean I have sufficient evidence for having it true for the population?** In this app, I have covered following tests:

1. One-sample test for mean when population standard deviation is known
2. One-sample test for mean when population standard deviation is not known
3. One-sample test for proportion
4. Two-samples test for the difference in means of two independent populations
5. Two-samples test for the difference in means of two paired populations
6. Two-samples test for the difference in proportion of two populations
7. ANOVA
8. Chi-square test
